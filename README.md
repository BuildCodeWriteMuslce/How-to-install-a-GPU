   _By:Jayton King

Hello all,

Today I will be explaining how to change/install a gpu into your pc.
This repository will be geared to any new pc owners, or those who have began the exciting process of building their own.


#Tutorial
(If you currently have no gpu then skip to step 9 otherwise start at 1)


1) Make sure your computer is off!! (we don't want you getting schocked!)
2) Remove any sort of case/glass that would allows access to the internals of your pc.
3) Locate your gpu. (should be a big horizontal compononent with wires connecting to it/usually has the brand name on it)
4) Disconnect any pins attached to your gpu. These are connected to the psu which powers your computer. (don't yank, there are latches to push down that will release the wires)
5) Locate the screws holding the gpu in place.
6) Remove the screws connecting from the gpu plate that runs towards the pcie slots.
7) Find the latche(s)/lever(s) towards the top of your gpu and gently apply pressure to them. (this will cause the gpu to be "ejected from its slot")
8) Carefully remove the gpu and set it down in a safe area.
9) Allign new gpu with pcie plate and gpu slot. (should be a thing rectangular area that the back of the gpu goes into)
10) Be careful not to jam the gpu into the socket, but make sure it is tightly secured before letting go.
11) Screw in the plates to secure the gpu.
12) Attach the wires from the psu into the gpu.
13) Close your pc case.
14) Turn on the power.
